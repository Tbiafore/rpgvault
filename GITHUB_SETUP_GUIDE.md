# GitHub Setup Guide for RPGVault

## Step 1: Download Your Project Files

1. **In Replit:** 
   - Your project files are ready in the `rpgvault-export` folder
   - Download this entire folder to your computer
   - You can do this by clicking the three dots next to the folder and selecting "Download"

## Step 2: Create GitHub Account & Repository

1. **Sign up for GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "Sign up" if you don't have an account
   - Choose a username (this will be visible in your repository URL)

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the green "New" button or go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - **Repository name**: `rpgvault` (or `RPGVault`)
   - **Description**: "Community-driven platform for tabletop RPG adventures"
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Public" (recommended) or "Private"
   - **Important**: Do NOT check "Add a README file" - we already have one
   - Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Upload Your Files to GitHub

### Method A: Web Upload (Easiest)

1. **On your new repository page:**
   - You'll see a page that says "Quick setup"
   - Click "uploading an existing file"

2. **Upload your files:**
   - Drag and drop ALL files from your `rpgvault-export` folder
   - Or click "choose your files" and select everything
   - **Important**: Make sure you upload the folder contents, not the folder itself

3. **Commit the files:**
   - Scroll down to "Commit new files"
   - Title: "Initial commit - RPGVault complete application"
   - Description: "Full-stack RPG community platform with 166+ adventures"
   - Click "Commit new files"

### Method B: Command Line (If you prefer)

If you have Git installed on your computer:

```bash
cd path/to/your/rpgvault-export
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - RPGVault complete application"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rpgvault.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Upload

Your repository should now contain:
- ✅ `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- ✅ `server/` folder with all backend files
- ✅ `client/` folder with all frontend files
- ✅ `shared/` folder with common code
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ Configuration files (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)

## Step 5: Ready for Railway Deployment

Once your files are on GitHub:
1. Your repository URL will be: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rpgvault`
2. You can now proceed with Railway deployment using the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
3. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js project and deploy it

## Troubleshooting

**If upload fails:**
- Try uploading files in smaller batches (10-20 files at a time)
- Make sure you're not uploading the `node_modules` folder (it's excluded in .gitignore)

**If you make mistakes:**
- You can delete the repository and start over
- Or create a new repository with a different name

## Next Steps

After successful GitHub upload:
1. Follow the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to deploy on Railway
2. Your therpgvault.com domain will point to your live application
3. All features (forums, reviews, 166 adventures) will be fully functional

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
- Double-check that all files uploaded correctly
- Ensure the repository structure matches what's shown above
- The repository should be ready for immediate deployment to Railway
